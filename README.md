# TestDynamicDrawer
Introduction
This example project demonstrates the use of MSDynamicsDrawerViewController in a simple scenario.\

Scenario:
I have a project in which I want to show the side menu on swipe gesture towards left. But I also have a login screen in my project where this side menu should not be visible.
I also don't want to enable this side menu on a view controller, if this view controller was navigated to, from a Navigation View Controller.
