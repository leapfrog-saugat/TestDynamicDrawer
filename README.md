# TestDynamicDrawer
#Introduction
This example project demonstrates the use of MSDynamicsDrawerViewController in a simple scenario.

#Scenario
I have a project in which I want to show the side menu on swipe gesture towards left. But I also have a login screen in my project where this side menu should not be visible.
I also don't want to enable this side menu on a view controller, if this view controller was navigated to, from a Navigation View Controller.

#Note
This project runs just fine. But some clean ups are necessary on the code. I will continue updating this project as soon as I can scrape some free time from my schedule. Comments are appreciated.
